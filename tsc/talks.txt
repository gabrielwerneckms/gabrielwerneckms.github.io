"level01-a1":"Welcome to the Totally Safe Castle.",
"level01-a2":"Everything here was built with your fun and safety in mind.",
"level01-a3":"Enjoy.",

"level01-b1":"Oh my. You shouldn't be greedy like that.",

"level01-c1":"Went a little too far, maybe?",

"level01-d1":"I see you've met our pretty christmas lights. ",
"level01-d2":"They're so cheerful, aren't they?",

"level01-f1":"The lights are everywhere, even in the ceiling.",
"level01-f2":"It's all very festive.",

"level01-g1":"Make sure to always follow the arrows and instructions. ",
"level01-g2":"They'll help you a lot!",

"level02-a1":"Meet Barney, the Citrus.",
"level02-a2":"He's here to keep you company if you get lonely.",
"level02-a3":"Go give him a hug.",

"level02-b1":"This is the inescapable room of confinement.",
"level02-b2":"There's no way to escape.",
"level02-b3":"Have a nice day.",

"level02-c1":"It's impossible to escape the Inescapable Room of Confinement.",
"level02-c2":"That's why it's called the Inescapable Room of Confinement.",
"level02-c3":"Because there's no way to escape.",

"level02-d1":"There's just nothing you can do.",
"level02-d2":"That wall to your right is as solid as my sense of style.",

"level02-e1":"Even if you, say, tried jumping against the wall, it wouldn't work.",
"level02-e2":"No.",

"level02-g1":"Hmm, someone left the pillar open.",
"level02-g2":"How irresponsible of them.",

"level02-h1":"Barney! What have I told you about killing adventurers?",
"level02-h2":"Bad, bad citrus.",

"level03-a1":"The floating coins with my face on them are called Shamladollars.",
"level03-a2":"They don't do anything, but they're very handsome.",

"level03-b1":"Gosh! What were you in such a hurry?",
"level03-b2":"It's not like you were ever gonna escape. Heh.",

"level03-c1":"Now these are some very safe jumps you'll be making.",
"level03-c2":"Jumping is a very safe thing to do, even if you,",
"level03-c3":"I don't know, land on a light or a citrus.",
"level03-c4":"You can jump without worrying.",

"level04-a1":"Dear adventurer,",
"level04-a2":"For your safety, running in the castle is strictly forbidden.",
"level04-a3":"The rooms were designed to be peaceful and relaxing, so please enjoy them slowly.",

"level04-b1":"See? I told you not to run.",

"level04-c1":"No, no, don't run. It's dangerous. Ahahah.",

"level04-d1":"Why do you adventurers keep insisting on running?",

"level04-e1":"Remember, tangerines are the only thing there is to eat in the castle.",
"level04-e2":"But don't worry, I made sure to put them in very accessible places.",
"level04-e3":"Heheheheheheh. Heh.",

"level05-a1":"I've left some splendid presents throughout my castle.",
"level05-a2":"These are all for you, my deeply beloved adventurer friends.",
"level05-a3":"The red ones are especially great.",

"level05-b1":"I didn't think you'd want to go trough the trouble of opening every present yourself,",
"level05-b2":"So I enchanted them to open themselves as soon as you stop next to them.",
"level05-b3":"Here in the Totally Safe Castle, we do everything to make your journey more pleasant.",

"level05-c1":"Make sure not to leave any present behind.",
"level05-c2":"They always have wonderful things inside, like cake or ponies.",

"level05-d1":"The red gifs are truly an explosion of fun.",
"level05-d2":"Ahahahah. Too soon?",

"level06-a1":"The colorful decoration in my castle was placed to help set a festive mood.",
"level06-a2":" I find it offensive when you bounce on my baloons.",
"level06-a3":"I've never invaded your home and stomped on your decoration, have I?",

"level06-b1":"To make things more fun, some of the doors in the castle are locked.",
"level06-b2":"But don't worry, you can always find the keys in places that are very easy to reach.",

"level07-a1":"Make sure to try each and every door in the castle.",
"level07-a2":"This way, you don't miss out on any of the wonderful attractions I've prepared.",

"level07-b1":"Remember you can bounce on the Citruses' heads to get to places faster.",
"level07-b2":"It's okay, they love getting bounced on!",

"level07-c1":"Nicely done! Great job.",
"level07-c2":"Now all you've got to do is grab your Shamladollars and head to the next challenge.",

"level07-d1":"How shocking. Hahahahah.",
"level07-d2":"Get it?",

"level07-e1":"Ahahah. I knew that would work.",

"level07-f1":"They always go in such a hurry!",

"level07-g1":"They keep doing it! Heheh.",

"level07-h1":"This part is really easy.",
"level07-h2":"All you need to do is go slowly and take your time.",
"level07-h3":"Don't worry! There's no danger.",

"level07-i1":"That Citrus had been waiting there for three years.",
"level07-i2":"Now he finally had his moment! Ahahah.",

"level08-a1":"Don't pay attention to the large number display above you.",
"level08-a2":"It's just a counter for how much fun I had watching you adventurers suffe-",
"level08-a3":"... uh, I mean, explore the castle.",
"level08-a4":"Just carry on, okay? Good.",

"level08-b1":"I just wanted to remind you that, while the Wrecking Balls might seem intimidating,",
"level08-b2":"They are actually cushion-y and totally harmless.",
"level08-b3":"A friend of mine loved to swing around on one of those and sing.",

"level08-f1":"This is the Very Straightforward Maze.",
"level08-f2":"It's very straightforward.",
"level08-f3":"You can obviously see what the correct way is,",
"level08-f4":"so just take it. It's gonna be easy.",
"level08-f5":"And straightforward.",

"level08-c1":"Since I'm so friendly and helpful, I'll give you a hint for this part.",
"level08-c2":"If you go bouncing on all the baloons on the right side, you might run into an obstacle.",
"level08-c3":"So make sure to go left instead.",
"level08-c4":"The left side is safe.",
"level08-c5":"Go left.",

"level08-d1":"Ahahah. Straight Up.",
"level09-a1":"I've noticed that there was a wiring problem with some of our festive blinking lights.",
"level09-a2":"I'm deeply sorry about that.",
"level09-a3":"From now on, you can touch the lights as much as you like without worrying.",

"level09-b1":"Good thing I fixed the lights, or this part would be really difficult, right?",

"level09-c1":"Don't forget your free gift!",

"level10-a1":"If you have any questions, suggestions or complaints about the Totally Safe Castle,",
"level10-a2":"you can place them in any of the pyres on the walls.",
"level10-a3":"They'll go straight to my 'Caring About Adventurers' drawer,",
"level10-a4":"which definitely exists.",

"level11-a1":"The Happy Halls are the perfect place for those who want friendship or company.",
"level11-a2":"I've decorated its walls with beautiful large statues of my head so you don't get lonely.",
"level11-a3":"You'll meet more new friends soon!",

"level11-b1":"The Citruses in the Happy Halls have a kind of tribal thing going.",
"level11-b2":"But don't worry, they're just as friendly and harmless as always.",

"level12-a1":"I've noticed some people find the castle rather dangerous.",
"level12-a2":"Apparently, its challenges are 'unfair' and 'not at all safe'.",
"level12-a3":"I totally disagree, but I am generous enough to provide you with this peaceful trap-free zone.",

"level12-b1":"The buttons on the floor might seem like traps to you.",
"level12-b2":"I assure you they're not.",
"level12-b3":"After all, why would there be traps in the Totally Safe Castle?",
"level12-b4":"Traps aren't safe. That wouldn't make any sense.",

"level12-c1":"You must be happy that the buttons are harmless.",
"level12-c2":"I mean, if they weren't, this room could be very dangerous.",

"level13-a1":"As you might have noticed, the Shamlaheads love to spit darts.",
"level13-a2":"It's their way of expressing affection.",

"level13-b1":"Once again, we have a very safe button for you to press.",
"level13-b2":"You can always count on the buttons and levers here in the Castle",
"level13-b3":"to never to anything remotely dangerous when activated.",

"level13-c1":"Not only you adventurers like to bounce on my baloons,",
"level13-c2":"A lot of you think it's fun to step on my statues, too.",
"level13-c3":"This is why I kill you al-",
"level13-c4":"Umm... I mean...",
"level13-c5":"This is why... You should have manners.",

"level14-a1":"I'm glad to introduce your lovely new Flying Friends",
"level14-a2":"They quietly await you in the next few rooms,",
"level14-a3":"eager to go give you a hug.",

"level14-b1":"You see the flying friends? Pay attention.",

"level15-a1":"Nothing is more relaxing and quiet than being near nature.",
"level15-a2":"Since the Happy Halls are blooming with wildlife already,",
"level15-a3":"I've decided to decorate them with my favorite flower.",

"level16-a1":"Did you know that plants won't bite you when youre in air?",
"level16-a2":"Just keep jumping and you'll be totally safe!",

"level17-a1":"The Shamlaheads around here spit fun-dartsthat go up and down.",
"level17-a2":"It's like a seesaw, or someone falling off a trampouline and getting badly injured.",
"level17-a3":"Not here in the castle, of course.",
"level17-a4":"The castle is very safe.",

"level18-a1":"I've noticed that many adventurers find it difficult to get the silver and gold keys in some rooms.",
"level18-a2":"So in this room I decided to make them all very easy to reach.",
"level18-a3":"All you need to do is jump, and you'll get all the keys you need!",

"level19-a1":"This is where most Flying Friends live.",
"level19-a2":"There's a lot of them just waiting to meet you.",
"level19-a3":"Imagine how many hugs you'll get!",

"level20-a1":"For the last room in the Happy Halls, I've decided to gather everyone together.",
"level20-a2":"The Shamladheads, the Flying Friends,and even the Friendly Flowers!",
"level20-a3":"Everyone is here. It's a party!",

"level21-a1":"Uh. You shouldn't be here.",
"level21-a2":"The Pleasant Parlor isn't really supposed to be open to visitors.",
"level21-a3":"I swear I had enchanted that last door to take you someplace else...",

"level21-b1":"Allow me to explain.",
"level21-b2":"These are my chambers.",
"level21-b3":"You shouldn't be here, and the cannon turrets will open fire at anyone not as stylish as myself.",
"level21-b4":"And noone is as stylish as myself.",

"level22-a1":"This is very rude of you. Okay?",
"level22-a2":"I gave you nothing but fun and enjoyment, and you refuse to obey a simple request.",
"level22-a3":"You adventurers are all the same. No respect.",

"level22-b1":"Yeah, you know what? Do whatever you want.",
"level22-b2":"I hope you get hit by a cannonball and die.",

"level23-a1":"Let's see how you do now, mr. I-don't-care-I-go-whatever-I-want.",
"level23-a2":"Look at me, I'm an adventurer! I ignore the requests of handsome wizards!",

"level24-a1":"Okay, okay. I apologize for getting angry at you.",
"level24-a2":"Feel free to explore whatever you like.",
"level24-a3":"My chambers are just as safe as the rest of the castle.",
"level24-a4":"Take the click-blocks, for instance.",
"level24-a5":"Why don't you go there and inspect them more closely?",

"level25-a1":"The bridges in these rooms are designed so you can just run across.",
"level25-a2":"They'll appear right under your feet. Like magic!",
"level25-a3":"There's no need to jump or wait.",
"level25-a4":"Just go and don't hesitate.",

"level25-b1":"Go left! Quick!.",

"level26-a1":"Since you're doing so well, I'll tell you a secret:",
"level26-a2":"Hit your head against a star cannon ten times in a row, and it'll stop shooting permanently.",
"level26-a3":"Cool, isn't it?",

"level26-b1":"Be aware of the lights on the floor. You wouldn't wanna land on them by accident, would you?",
"level27-a1":"To unlock the way to the final door, you need to pull a lever at room two.", 
"level27-a2":"Room two is the third one from left to right, between the bottom and the top of the tower diagonally.",
"level27-a3":"Go through the leftmost door first, of course.",

"level27-b1":"Make sure you don't forget to not deactivate this clicker.",
"level27-b2":"Otherwise maybe you won't not forget to remember to not go to room three later.",

"level27-c1":"The bronze doors here all move to the left, except for the left one that goes right.",
"level27-c2":"The left door is the right one. Of course, if you've already gone there,", 
"level27-c3":"you took the left one and the right one is left. Right?",

"level27-d1":"This is the third room from top to bottom.",
"level27-d2":"This means it's the first one so you should visit it last.",
"level27-d3":"Remember: This is room number two.",

"level27-e1":"Ah, room seven. This is my favorite one.", 
"level27-e2":"Go through this room right after room three, but never before room five.",
"level27-e3":"Room eight will surprise you!",

"level27-f1":"If I were you, I wouldn't go through this door.",
"level27-f2":"Try the secret room to the right of the baloons instead.",

"level28-a1":"Still exploring my chambers, aren't you?",
"level28-a2":"Did you know that, uh, you can bounce on a Fancy Citrus' hat?",
"level28-a3":"It works like a baloon! Give it a try! Do it!",

"level29-a1":"The click blocks here click very slowly. This means they're very safe, as there's plenty of time to interact with them",
"level29-a2":"Just go on top of the blocks and don't worry about speed.",

"level30-a1":"Alright. I'll drop the act.",
"level30-a2":"I've watching you progress all this time.",
"level30-a3":"I can't understand how you managed to get all the way here with all the traps I've set.",
"level30-a4":"But I admire your persistence, so I'll be fair with you for once.",
"level30-a5":"Go through this final door, and if you defeat me in combat, you'll be free at last.",

"tangerine1":"Tangerines are the best. Remember, there's nothing else to eat.",
"tangerine2":"Give my tangerines a try! I made th- uh, I picked them myself.",
"tangerine3":"Would you like some cake? That's a shame. There's nothing to eat in the castle but tangerines.",
"tangerine4":"Eating tangerines is very important. Especially if there's no other food.",
"tangerine5":"Tangerines are very good for you.",
"tangerine6":"I hope you like tangerines. There's nothing else to eat in the castle, remember?",
"tangerin7":"Remember, adventurers: Cool people eat lots of tangerines.",
"tangerine8":"Oh, I love tangerines so much. ",
"tangerine9":"Tangerines have vitamin T. It's the most important vitamin there is.",
"tangerine10":"Don't forget to eat your tangerines. ",
"tangerine11":"Tangerines, tangerines, tangerines! Best fruit in the world!!",
"tangerine12":"Remember: Nothing in the world is more important than tangerines.",
"tangerine13":"Hate starving to death? Grab some tangerines!",
"tangerine14":"The Totally Safe Castle has the best tangerines in town.",
"tangerine15":"Tangerines, tangerines, tangerines... Tangerines.",
"tangerine16":"There's nothing better than tangerines. Except for tangerines, maybe.",
"tangerine17":"Tangerines, or world peace? Tangerines, of course!",
"tangerine18":"If I could have any three things I wanted, I would ask for three tangerines.",
"tangerine19":"Tangerines are the superior fruit. No other fruit can compare. Do you hear me?? NONE!",
"tangerine20":"Have you ever seen a tangerine? They are beautiful and juicy.",
"tangerine21":"Did you know that a single tangerine has all the nutrients your body needs to survive for a week?",
"tangerine22":"I really like pineapples. Just kidding! Tangerines are still the best.",
"tangerine23":"Some people ask me: What's the secret to being so handsome? It's the tangerines, of course.",
"tangerine24":"It's like I always say: Tangerines.",
"tangerine25":"Roses are red, tangerines are orange. I mean the color, not the fruit. The fruit is called tangerine.",
"tangerine26":"Oh, tangerines. What a wonderful fruit.",
"tangerine27":"Have I mentioned I really like tangerines?",
"tangerine28":"Not only tangerines are healthy, they are very stylish, too. They're just perfect.",
"tangerine29":"Some people think the lion is the king of the jungle. WRONG! It's the tangerine.",
"tangerine30":"I hate adventurers. But I love tangerines.",

"dead1":"Uh-oh. Better luck next time.",
"dead2":"Uh-oh. Ahahah.",
"dead3":"Whoops. Ahahahah.",
"dead4":"That must have hurt.",
"dead5":"Dead!",
"dead6":"See you later. Or not.",
"dead7":"Oh well. Another one.",
"dead8":"Oh, you passed away.",
"dead9":"How unfortunate. Ahahahah.",
"dead10":"Another one bites the dust.",
"dead11":"Bye, adventurer!",
"dead12":"And that's the end of their adventure.",
"dead13":"Goodbye.",
"dead14":"Bye!",
"dead15":"Rest in peace.",
"dead16":"Nice try.",
"dead17":"No.",
"dead18":"Naah.",
"dead19":"Pfft, were you even trying?",
"dead20":"Oh well. Ahahah.",
"dead21":"Nah, nope.",
"dead22":"Bye bye!",
"dead23":"Adiós.",
"dead24":"Hasta la vista!",
"dead25":"Why do you guys keep dying? It's all so safe!",
"dead26":"Sayonara!",
"dead27":"Another adventurer.",
"dead28":"See ya!",
"dead29":"That was terrible.",
"dead30":"Another! Ahahah.",
"dead31":"Good try.",
"dead32":"Ahahahah!",
"dead33":"That was close.",
"dead34":"Oh. Okay.",
"dead35":"You're dead!",
"dead36":"Yeah, you're dead.",
"dead37":"You passed away.",
"dead38":"You have perished!",
"dead39":"Nope!",
"dead40":"You've failed! Ahahah.",
"dead41":"How terrible.",
"dead42":"Awful, awful job.",
"dead43":"Great one! Ahahah.",
"dead44":"Ahahah, great job.",
"dead45":"Don't worry, death is a part of life.",
"dead46":"My condolences. Ahahah.",
"dead47":"Gotcha!",
"dead48":"Ouch.",
"dead49":"Oh my! Ahahah.",
"dead50":"Keep them coming!",
"dead51":"More adventurers! More!",
"dead52":"Oh well, it was worth a try.",
"dead53":"What were you thinking?",
"dead54":"You're dead. It's okay. It happens.",

"deadguy1":"I should have mentioned the citruses are very well-trained in martial arts.",
"deadguy2":"That move is called 'the adventurer-slayer.' It slays adventurers. Ahahah.",
"deadguy3":"Ouch. He got you good. Ahahah!",
"deadguy4":"Yeah, beat them up!",
"deadguy5":"Ahahah. I love violence.",
"deadguy6":"Yeah, get them all, citrus!",

"deadboom1":"Boom! Ahahah. Red gifts are the best.",
"deadboom2":"The red gifts are truly an explosion of fun.",
"deadboom3":"Kabooom! Gotta love the red gifts.",
"deadboom4":"You have such an explosive personality! Ahahah.",
"deadboom5":"You appear to have exploded.",
"deadboom6":"Ahahah! That was a very safe explosion.",

"deadlights1":"How shocking! Ahahah.",
"deadlights2":"Going on an adventure is an electrifying experience!",
"deadlights3":"What a shock!",
"deadlights4":"Don't worry. Electric shocks are actually good for you.",
"deadlights5":"Bzzz! Ahahahah.",
"deadlights6":"They keep getting eletrocuted! Heh.",
"deadlights7":"The Totally Safe Castle offers the safest electric shocks in the world.",

"deadplant1":"It seems like you were eaten by a friendly flower.",
"deadplant2":"What can I say, the plants are really hungry.",
"deadplant3":"Ouch. That was a big bite.",
"deadplant4":"Ahahahah! I love the friendly flowers.",

"deadpoison1":"It appears you have been poisoned.",
"deadpoison2":"Don't worry. The poison in the fun-darts is very safe.",
"deadpoison3":"You look a bit pale! Ahahah.",
"deadpoison4":"You don't seem very healthy.",
"deadpoison5":"Oh my. You don't look so good.",

"deadcrush1":"It seems you've got crushed.",
"deadcrush2":"Crushing it!",
"deadcrush3":"You crushed it! Ahahah.",
"deadcrush4":"What a squishy adventurer.",
"deadcrush5":"I can hear the bones crushing! Ahahah.",

"deadbroken1":"Rest in pieces. Ahahah.",
"deadbroken2":"Oh. It seems you broke into bits.",
"deadbroken3":"I love it when they break down like that.",
"deadbroken4":"Ahahah. I love the wrecking balls.",
"deadbroken5":"Get wrecked!",
"deadbroken6":"Maybe I'll start making my own adventurers with all these parts."}}
